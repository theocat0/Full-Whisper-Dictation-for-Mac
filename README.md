# Project Repository

**For anyone unfortunate enough to stumble upon this, this is my first repository. Here, I would like to use the OpenAI Whisper model to replace the dictation function on my Mac. The reason I'm doing this is for a learning experience. I think it is beneficial for me as a young coder, and, additionally, I am very dyslexic. It is extremely difficult for me to type as quickly as I speak, and I find it much more convenient to use dictation all the time rather than typing. As such, this is why I'm here. The very rough roadmap should look something like: Experiment Whisper, Experiment MacOS, Stability.**

## Project Roadmap

1. **Experiment with Whisper Model**
   - Develop a basic application to implement the Whisper model for dictation.
   - Test various configurations to optimize accuracy and speed.

2. **Experiment with MacOS Integration**
   - Address MacOS-specific challenges to integrate the dictation effectively.
   - Create a seamless activation shortcut similar to existing MacOS dictation features.

3. **Ensure System Stability**
   - Focus on the reliability and robustness of the application for daily use.
   - Implement error handling and continuous performance testing.

## Conclusion

This project aims to merge advanced AI dictation capabilities with user-friendly MacOS integration, specifically tailored to enhance accessibility for users like myself who face challenges with traditional typing due to dyslexia. Your interest and feedback are invaluable as I undertake this learning journey. Thank you for your support!
